# Motion Analysis via Microsoft Kinect V2

**A framework for the acquisition of body joints with their corresponding colorful frames and the analysis of some simple medical test cases in MATLAB.**

We have used Microsoft [Kinect Kinect SDK 2.0](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/9bdc43fa-ccde-47aa-bac9-7f93c652f99f/math-behind-coordinate-mapper?forum=kinectv2sdk) at acquisition of frames and [OpenCV 3.0](https://opencv.org/opencv-3-0.html) at manipulation of the captured colorful frames.
